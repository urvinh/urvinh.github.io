Welcome to Zeit, a personal blog by Vinh Pham.

Hi... I'm Vinh Pham. I'm currently an undergrad student at University of Information Technology in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I'm studing networking and telecommunications but I also like coding. I mostly code JavaScript, TypeScript. And by writing this blog, I'm sharing to you what I know although it's may not much. Hope you enjoy.
