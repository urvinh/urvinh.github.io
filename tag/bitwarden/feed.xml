      <content type="html" xml:base="/bitwarden">&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been obsessed about Bitwarden, an open source password managing tool. Although kind of new in the field, Bitwarden has proven to be the best password manager around with affordable price. “Affordable” here, I meant it’s basically free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comming from 1Password, I wasn’t actually looking for a new service. I was satisfied with what 1Password. And one day, I decide I have to reduce costs and 1Password’s $3.99/month became too much. I looked for other option and ta-da, Bitwarden came up like a life-saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitwarden offer free plan with basic password managing feature that suits for most people. What makes Bitwarden stand out is that it allow you to sync your password to multiple devices with free plan. I know LastPass also offer this but I personally don’t like its UI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
