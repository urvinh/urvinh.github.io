      <content type="html" xml:base="/travis-ci-to-github-actions">&lt;p&gt;As you may already know, for this website, I’m using Jekyll with the help with some automations from Travis CI for the past two years. Because that’s what the theme developer had recommended. But recently, Travis has decided to combine travis-ci.org and travis-ci.com and I had some problems with the migration to travis-ci.com. Authentication seemed never working. After many frustrated attempts to fix it, I decided to move to something else. There are so many options, but since I’m using GitHub, why not use the in-house solution, GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lets-started&quot;&gt;Let’s started…&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my limited knowledge of GitHub Actions, I know there will have to be a &lt;em&gt;config file&lt;/em&gt;, just like Travis. It should be located at &lt;strong&gt;.github/workflows/&lt;/strong&gt;. The file should be in YAML format and the name shouldn’t matter. In my case, it’s &lt;em&gt;main.yml&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you create it from the GitHub user interface, the sample file will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
push:
    branches: [ master ]
pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
# This workflow contains a single job called &quot;build&quot;
build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Run a one-line script
    run: echo Hello, world!

    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    - name: Run a multi-line script
    run: |
        echo Add other actions to build,
        echo test, and deploy your project.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/dev-environment">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I write or develop something. A year… perhap. Maybe it’s time to update that article that I writed on Medium about my dev environment…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoilers alert! It’s not as that fancy as the cover image that I use above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a year has passed. As the times change, people change, and so do their tools. In the web development world, even a month can make you surprised at how thing are different compare to one month ealier. But now I talk about one year… one whole year…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year later, I still use WSL or formerly Bash on Windows. Surprise, surprise. Some may say, “Ugh! This guy is nut. WSL sucks… blah… blah…” But nah… Thing’s still going great with WSL, Microsoft even put many Linux distros on Microsoft Store now to make the installation process easier. And there’s even an terminal app for Windows 10 that look this cool, making using it such a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018/Jul/fl-terminal.png&quot; alt=&quot;Fluent Terminal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even choose light theme. BAAM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… what’s this terminal’s name again? It’s &lt;strong&gt;Fluent Terminal&lt;/strong&gt; by felixse, you can check it out at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal&quot;&gt;https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s talk about text editor. Yes, I still use Visual Studio Code because it’s too perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018/Jul/vscode.png&quot; alt=&quot;Visual Studio Code&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
