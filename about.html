<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  Hi, I'm Vinh Pham. I do stuffs with computer and sometimes write about it here.
</p>

<p>
  I studied Networking and Telecommunications at University of Information Technology
  - Vietnam National University (HCMC). I spent over two years working in sysadmin and DevOps.
  Currently, I'm working as a developer. I want to use this small website to share my experiences
  and I hope with it, I can help others too.
