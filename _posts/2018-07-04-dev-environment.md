It's been a while since I write or develop something. A year... perhap. Maybe it's time to update that article that I writed on Medium about my dev environment...

Spoilers alert! It's not as that fancy as the cover image that I use above.

So a year has passed. As the times change, people change, and so do their tools. In the web development world, even a month can make you surprised at how thing are different compare to one month ealier. But now I talk about one year... one whole year...

One year later, I still use WSL or formerly Bash on Windows. Surprise, surprise. Some may say, "Ugh! This guy is nut. WSL sucks... blah... blah..." But nah... Thing's still going great with WSL, Microsoft even put many Linux distros on Microsoft Store now to make the installation process easier. And there's even an terminal app for Windows 10 that look this cool, making using it such a joy.

You can even choose light theme. BAAM!

So... what's this terminal's name again? It's **Fluent Terminal** by felixse, you can check it out at <https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal>

Now, let's talk about text editor. Yes, I still use Visual Studio Code because it's too perfect.
